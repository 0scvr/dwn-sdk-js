# hub-sdk-js 

## Introduction

This repository contains a reference implementation of Identity Hubs as per the [specification](https://identity.foundation/identity-hub/spec/). This specification is in a draft state and very much so a WIP. For the foreseeable future, a lot of the work on Identity Hubs will be split across this repo and the repo that houses the specification, which you can find [here](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/identity-hub). The overall goal is to produce a v1.0 specification along with a reference implementation by 07/01/2022. 


Proposals for the specification itself should be submitted as pull requests to the [spec repo](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/identity-hub). Similarly, issues pertaining to the specification itself should be submitted as github issues to the [spec repo](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/identity-hub).
